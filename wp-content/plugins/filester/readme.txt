###🔑 HOW IT WORKS

Filester plugin enables you to easily manage WordPress files so that you don’t have to access directories via FTP or cPanel. 

This plugin creates a new menu **File Manager** in your WordPress dashboard. From then on, you can view all server files, configuration files and media files in your current WordPress website.

You can edit, copy, upload/download files/folders to your server from File Manager section. This toolbar is similar to the settings in an FTP client. It allows you to preview, edit, upload, download, duplicate and delete files or folders.

All webmasters can also download WordPress media library using [Filester - File Manager Pro](https://ninjateam.org/download-wordpress-media-library/) as well.

Manual installation is easy and takes fewer than one minute.

1. Download the plugin from wordpress.org, unpack it and upload the **[Filester]** folder to your **wp-content/plugins/** directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins‘ menu in WordPress.
3. Go to your main **WordPress menu > File Manager** to use.

You’re done. Enjoy.
